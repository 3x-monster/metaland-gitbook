# Meat

Meat, which is designed to be pure consumables, is the essential resource monsters need to act in the world. For example, Meat needs to be consumed during the egg hatching process, be carried on a dungeon adventure, and be carried to work to earn Copper. \
\
Meat is purchased with Copper. **Copper which is used to purchase Meat will be burned directly.**\
\
A Meat NPC is preset in game. The price of Meat will be determined based on Copper circulating in the market. And Meat would be dropped occasionally in dungeon.
