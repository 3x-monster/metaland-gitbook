Eggs will be divided into three levels. Namely level1, level2, level3 and level3 is the highest. The level of eggs depends on the value of the eggs, as shown below.

> Eggs Value = Monster Advantage Attribute Value + D6

The higher the monsterâ€™s advantage attribute value, the higher the probability of producing high-level eggs.

The egg incubation cycle is **7** days.

The level of the egg will affect the rarity of randomly generated monsters, which is the challenge rating CR. Don't take 'high level egg produces high CR monster' for granted. It just increased the probability.

2. **breaking phrase:** Monster Reborn breaks the shell.
